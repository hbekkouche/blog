## Use Hugo while developing a site
```
hugo server
```

## Deploy Your Website
After running hugo server for local web development, you need to do a final ```hugo``` run without the ```server``` part of the command to rebuild your site. You may then deploy your site by copying the public/ directory to your production web server.
